 Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm
 
 
A SCARA Robot is a simple three
linked, robotic module which is
flexible in 3 dimensions. This
modular device can be further
improved on by means of adding
a grappling arm and
modifications at the end effector.
Aim is to further be able to teach
the module to grab objects.
